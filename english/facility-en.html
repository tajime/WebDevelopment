            <h2>Courtyard</h2>
            <p>
                This is the boasting courtyard of our school. The courtyard was designed by Gar-den, a world-renowned gardener. In sunny day,
                sunlight falls and eating in a calm atmosphere is a world-class dish. In this garden, concert of the school's proud brass band and choir
                is held once a month. You can also take an elegant lunch while enjoying the performances of the brass band and choir.
                It seems that some students decided to enroll for a wonderful lunch time.

                The price is around 4 dollars, and it is affordable. We have dedicated dietitian for "cheap and delicious".
                In addition, there is an annual passport, which is as low as 3.8 dollars per meal, and about half of students use this.
                Also, there are also purchases in the back of the cafeteria, so please use this when you are short on time or hungry.

            <h2>Nap room</h2>
            <p>
                Our school also has a nap room. Taking a nap has been shown to be very effective for afternoon activities,
                and our school has decided to incorporate it this year. Thorough air conditioning management and hygiene management allow you to take a comfortable nap.
                The introduction of the nap room has been very successful and has received positive feedback from many students and parents.
                At times, the nap room is full and there is not enough space, so we are currently considering expanding the nap room.

                as you might imagine formal space, but our school has an open computer room like the one in the photo, which stimulates students' creativity.
                In this PC room, we have prepared the latest personal computer. Therefore, don't worry about preparing your own PC.
